# Fake_News_Prediction

I have trained the model with the train.csv downloaded from kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv

What I learnt?
1. NLTK library which is used for pre-processing of the data
  a. Tokenizing words & sentences
  b. StopWords and how to remove that
  c. Stemming & Lemmatizing
  d. Sentimental Analysis
  e. Meaning of word using wordnet

2. TF-IDF(Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) which coverts words to vectors
3. Logistic Regression which is used for classifing the output as 0 or 1

 
My future scope is to merge this fake news classifier with my portfolio management database.

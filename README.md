# Fake_News_Prediction

I have trained the model with the train.csv downloaded from kaggle.com<br />
https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv

What did I learn?
1. NLTK library which is used for pre-processing the data<br />
  a. Tokenizing words & sentences <br />
  b. StopWords and how to remove that<br />
  c. Stemming & Lemmatizing<br />
  d. Sentimental Analysis<br />
  e. Meaning of word using wordnet<br />

3. TF-IDF(Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) which coverts words to vectors
4. Logistic Regression which is used for classifying the output as 0 or 1

 
My future scope is to merge this fake news classifier with my portfolio management database.
